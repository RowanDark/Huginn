Huginn is a next-generation OSINT (Open Source Intelligence) web scraping platform that combines the performance of Go, the security of Rust, and the AI capabilities of Python into a unified, distributed system designed for large-scale intelligence operations.

🏗️ Architecture
Huginn employs a multi-language microservices architecture:

Go Engine: High-performance core scraping engine with distributed worker pools

Rust Security: Advanced anti-detection, browser fingerprinting, and TLS management

Python AI: Natural language processing, threat intelligence, and machine learning analysis
