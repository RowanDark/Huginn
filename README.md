OSINT Web Scraping Engine
A high-performance, distributed web scraping engine specifically designed for OSINT (Open Source Intelligence) and cybersecurity applications. Built in Go, this engine provides advanced anti-detection capabilities, distributed architecture, and comprehensive data extraction features.

Features
Core Engine Features
Concurrent Web Scraping: Efficient web scraping using Go's goroutines and channels

Anti-Detection Mechanisms: Browser fingerprint management, proxy rotation, and user agent rotation

Rate Limiting: Configurable rate limiting to avoid IP blocks

Distributed Architecture: Scalable worker architecture for high-volume scraping

Job Queue System: Redis-based priority queue with retry mechanism

Advanced Features
Multiple Target Types: Email extraction, subdomain discovery, social media profiling, and general data collection

Campaign Management: Create and manage campaigns with multiple targets

Proxy Management: Automatic proxy rotation, health checking, and proxy pool management

Data Validation: Comprehensive data validation and normalization

API Integration: RESTful API for job management and result retrieval

Monitoring & Statistics: Real-time statistics and monitoring

Architecture
The OSINT Engine follows a distributed microservices architecture with several key components:

Core Engine: Manages web scraping, anti-detection, and data extraction

Worker Pool: Handles concurrent job processing with auto-scaling capability

Job Queue: Redis-based priority queue system with retry mechanism

Proxy Manager: Handles proxy rotation, testing, and health monitoring

API Layer: RESTful API for interacting with the system

Configuration: YAML-based configuration with environment variable support

Components
Engine (cmd/osint-engine)
The main application that runs both the scraping engine and workers. It manages the worker pool, job distribution, and result collection.

Worker (cmd/osint-worker)
Standalone worker application that can be deployed separately to distribute the workload. Workers pull jobs from the queue, process them, and push results back.

API (cmd/osint-api)
RESTful API server that provides endpoints for job management, result retrieval, and system monitoring.

Configuration
The system is configured through a YAML file (config.yaml). Key configuration sections include:

server: Server configuration (host, port, timeouts)

redis: Redis connection settings

scraper: Scraping settings (concurrency, rate limits, anti-detection)

api: API server settings (rate limits, authentication)

security: Security settings (API keys, compliance mode)

logging: Logging configuration

Getting Started
Prerequisites
