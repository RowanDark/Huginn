OSINT Engine Architecture
Overview
The OSINT Engine is designed as a distributed system with multiple components that work together to provide scalable, resilient web scraping capabilities. The architecture follows modern microservices principles, with clearly defined boundaries between components and a focus on scalability and maintainability.

Key Design Principles
Separation of Concerns: Each component has a specific responsibility

Horizontal Scalability: Components can be scaled independently

Resilience: The system can recover from failures

Configurability: Components are highly configurable

Security: Security considerations are built into the design

Component Architecture
Core Scraping Engine
The scraping engine is responsible for managing the web scraping process. It includes:

Collector Management: Creates and manages web collectors

Rate Limiting: Controls request rates to avoid detection

Anti-Detection: Implements browser fingerprint management

Data Extraction: Extracts structured data from web pages

Worker Pool
The worker pool manages a collection of worker goroutines that process scraping jobs. Features include:

Concurrent Processing: Multiple workers process jobs simultaneously

Auto-Scaling: Workers can be added or removed based on load

Load Balancing: Jobs are distributed evenly across workers

Graceful Shutdown: Workers complete current jobs before shutting down

Job Queue
The job queue manages the flow of jobs through the system:

Priority Queuing: Higher priority jobs are processed first

Retry Mechanism: Failed jobs can be retried with exponential backoff

Dead Letter Queue: Permanently failed jobs are moved to a dead letter queue

Job Tracking: Jobs are tracked through their lifecycle

Proxy Manager
The proxy manager handles proxy rotation and health checking:

Proxy Rotation: Rotates proxies to avoid detection

Health Checking: Regularly checks proxy health

Connection Pooling: Maintains a pool of proxy connections

Proxy Types: Supports HTTP, HTTPS, and SOCKS5 proxies

API Layer
The API layer provides a RESTful interface to the system:

Resource Management: CRUD operations for targets, jobs, and results

Campaign Management: Create and manage scraping campaigns

Authentication: API key and JWT authentication

Rate Limiting: Controls API access rates

Data Flow
Client submits a scraping job via the API

API server validates the request and creates a job

Job is added to the job queue

Worker pulls job from queue

Worker gets a proxy from the proxy manager

Worker processes the job using the scraping engine

Results are stored in the result storage

Client retrieves results via the API

Deployment Architecture
The system supports multiple deployment configurations:

Single-Node Deployment
All components run on a single node, suitable for development or small-scale deployments.

Distributed Deployment
Components are distributed across multiple nodes:

API servers behind a load balancer

Worker nodes scaled horizontally

Redis for distributed queue and coordination

Centralized result storage

Kubernetes Deployment
The system can be deployed on Kubernetes with:

Deployments for API and worker components

Stateful sets for Redis and storage

Services for internal communication

Ingress for external access

Scaling Considerations
The system is designed to scale horizontally by:

Adding more worker nodes to process more jobs

Adding more API servers to handle more requests

Scaling Redis using clustering or sharding

Using a distributed file system for result storage

Security Considerations
The system includes several security features:

API key authentication

CORS protection

Rate limiting

Input validation

Secure configuration handling

TLS support
